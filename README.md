# Web Activity Time Tracker 

People tend to browse the web for numerous hours and during these hours sometimes they fail to be productive. In this era of social media where short videos have taken over the world, time seems to flow without much realization. 

 Here is a chrome extension that will track all the time you are spending on each website. And provide analytical information to organize the time you are spending on the internet. 

 

The aim of this project will be to make people focus on productivity and reduce the time spent on distractive websites like Instagram, Facebook, Netflix, etc.

Extension uses only local  chrome.storage API to store data and it doesn't send data anywhere.



You can see your daily stats.



And you can see your overall stats.





```npm start```
